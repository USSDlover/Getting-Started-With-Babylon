### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is kind of boiler plate for working with babylonjs, as it is said on official web site that
it is almost hard to make local dev environment `Actually it was`

##### Start

Usage is simple enough as just need to run
`npm i`
and
`npm start`

##### Structure

Structure is simple

|- public <br>
|- src <br>
|-|- assets <br>
|-|- base <br>
|-|- interfaces <br>
|-|- scenes <br>
|-|- app.ts <br>

`app.ts` is responsible to load main scene
So all you need to load your new scene, is to create new instance of that class


`base` Contains some bas classes that may be usefull stay away from so many duplicated code

##### Extra

As I created this repo when I just started to look into BabylonJS and learn from official documentations

There is `getting-started` folder available under `scenes` folder, that is my own practice on following
documents.
